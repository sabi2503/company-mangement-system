CRUD refers to the four basic operations a software application should be able to perform – Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

In such apps, users must be able to create data, have access to the data in the UI by reading the data, update or edit the data, and delete the data.

In full-fledged applications, CRUD apps consist of 3 parts: an API (or server), a database, and a user interface (UI).

The API contains the code and methods, the database stores and helps the user retrieve the information, while the user interface helps users interact with the app.

You can make a CRUD app with any of the programming languages out there. And the app doesn’t have to be full stack – you can make a CRUD app with client-side JavaScript.

In fact, the app with which I will be showing you how create, read, update and delete operations work is made with client-side JavaScript.

Each letter in the CRUD acronym has a corresponding HTTP request method.

CRUD OPERATION	HTTP REQUEST METHOD
Create	POST
Read	GET
Update	PUT or PATCH
Delete	DELETE
